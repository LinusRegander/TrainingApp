Main Package Structure:
- In "common [training-common]" you will find the src folder containing the main code for the application.
- In the src folder you will find 3 additional folder: css, guibuilder and java.
- The css folder contains the css file "theme.css" where the design compartment of the GUI can be found.
- The java folder contains the main code structured with the MVC model.
- The Training class can be ignored as it is not used at this moment. Because of a sensitive framework we have left it there as removing it can cause issues.
